# ROS-Manipulation
Packages created for manipulation in ROS
The robots used were fetch and rbkairos. I have included there URDF files for reference.
A lot of configuration and helper files were used. 
But what I observed is ROS makes grasping very easy, with just few configurations of MoveIt and other files, it was able to do 
what I have done(in a capstone project) in a very short time. And configuration must be done only for the runtime.
